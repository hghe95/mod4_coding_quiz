Module 4 Challenge
Coding Quiz -  Where Being Wrong Will Cost You

In this assignment we were asked to create a multiple choice quiz. The acceptance criteria included the use of a start button, questions appearing consecutively upon answering, a time penalty if a question is answered incorrectly, the game completing when all questions have been answered or when the time has elasped, and the opportunity to save a personal score with initials.
